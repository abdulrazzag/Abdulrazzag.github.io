###Checking Missing Packages and Install and/or Load them
```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
list.of.packages <- c("foreign", "kableExtra", "ggplot2", "knitr","formattable","dplyr", "rockchalk", "margins")

new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

###Study variables

# Smoking-and-birthweight data

Here we consider a subset of data on birth outcomes, provided by Abrevaya (2006), which is analyzed in chapter 3. The data were derived from birth certificates by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics. The variables in smoking.dta that we will consider here are:

* momid: mother identifier

* idx: chronological numbering of multiple children to the same mother in the database (1: first child; 2: second child; 3: third child)

* birwt: birthweight (in grams)

* mage: mother's age at the birth of the child (in years)
* smoke: dummy variable for mother smoking during pregnancy (1: smoking; 0: not smoking)
* male: dummy variable for baby being male (1: male; 0: female)

* hsgrad: dummy variable for mother having graduated from high school

* somecoll: dummy variable for mother having some college education (but no degree)

* collgrad: dummy variable for mother having graduated from college

* black: dummy variable for mother being black (1: black; 0: white)

```{r ReadingData}

smoking.data <- read.dta("https://github.com/abdulrazzag/Abdulrazzag.github.io/raw/master/smoking.dta")
head(smoking.data)

```
###<span style="color:blue">Question One</span>
**1. Keep only the data on each mother's first birth, that is, where idx is 1.**

```{r}
smoking.data2 <- smoking.data[which(smoking.data$idx==1),]
dim(smoking.data2)
```
###<span style="color:blue">Question Two</span>

**2. Create the variable education, taking the value 1 if hsgrad is 1, the value 2 if somecoll is 1, the value 3 if collgrad is 1, and the value 0 otherwise.**

```{r}
smoking.data2$education<- factor(ifelse(smoking.data2$hsgrad==1,1, ifelse(smoking.data2$somecoll==1, 2, ifelse(smoking.data2$collgrad==1,3,0))), labels=c("Other","HSGrad","SomeColl","ColGrad")) 

##If you are like me and don't like the tedious ifelse statements above, use this code instead:
##smoking.data2$education <- smoking.data2$hsgrad*1+smoking.data2$somecoll*2+smoking.data2$collgrad*3

with(smoking.data2, table(male,smoke,black,education))

```
###<span style="color:blue">Question Three</span>
**3. Produce a table of the means and standard deviations of birwt for all the subgroups defined by smoke, education, male, and black. Hint: Use the table command with smoke as rowvar, education as colvar, and male and black as superrowvars; see help table.**

```{r tabularmeansSD}
# means <- aggregate(smoking.data2$birwt, list(smoking.data2$smoke, smoking.data2$education, smoking.data2$male, smoking.data2$black),mean)
# SDs <- aggregate(smoking.data2$birwt, list(smoking.data2$smoke, smoking.data2$education, smoking.data2$male, smoking.data2$black),sd)
# descriptives <- cbind(means, SDs)


#devtools::install_github("haozhu233/kableExtra")

descriptives <- do.call(data.frame, aggregate(birwt ~ smoke+education+male+black, data = smoking.data2, FUN = function(x) c(mn = mean(x), sd = sd(x))))

###<span style="color:blue">Question Four</span>

**4. Produce box plots for the same groups. Hint: Use the asyvars option and the over() option for each grouping variable except the last (starting with over(education)), and use the by() option for the last grouping variable. Use the nooutsides option to suppress the display of outliers, making the graph easier to interpret. What do you observe?**

```{r}
#boxplot(smoking.data2[which(smoking.data2$smoke=='Smoker' & smoking.data2$male=='Female' & smoking.data2$black=='White'),9])
with(smoking.data2, boxplot(birwt~smoke+male+black+education, outline=FALSE, col = ifelse(smoking.data2$education == 0, "violet", ifelse(smoking.data2$education == 1, "yellow1", ifelse(smoking.data2$education == 2,"skyblue","orange1")))))


ggplot(aes(y = birwt, x = smoke, fill = education), data = smoking.data2) + geom_boxplot(outlier.color = NA)+ facet_wrap(~black+male)

# ggplot(smoking.data2, aes(birwt, interactions, fill=interactions)) +
#   stat_boxplot(geom ='errorbar')+
#   geom_boxplot()
# smoking.data2$interactions <- interaction(smoking.data2$male, smoking.data2$black, smoking.data2$smoke, smoking.data2$education)

```

###<span style="color:blue">Question Five</span>
**5. Regress birwt on smoke and interpret the estimated regression coefficients.**

```{r results='asis'}
reg.model1 <- lm(birwt ~ smoke, data = smoking.data2)
m0.or <- outreg(list("Linear Model" = reg.model1), type = "html", browse  = FALSE)
m0.or <- gsub("[ ]{2,}", " ", m0.or)
cat(m0.or)
#summary(reg.model1)

```

###<span style="color:blue">Question Six</span>

**6. Add mage, male, black, hsgrad, somecoll, and collgrad to the model in step 5.**

```{r results='asis', warning=FALSE}

reg.model2 <- lm(birwt ~ smoke+mage+male+black+education, data = smoking.data2)
#summary(reg.model)


#m0 <- lm(mathach ~ ses, data = hsb2)

m0.or <- outreg(list("Linear Model" = reg.model2), type = "html", browse  = FALSE)
m0.or <- gsub("[ ]{2,}", " ", m0.or)
cat(m0.or)
```

###<span style="color:blue">Question Seven</span>

**7. Interpret each of the estimated regression coefficients from step 6.**



###<span style="color:blue">Question Eight</span>

**8. Discuss the difference in the estimated coefficient of smoke from steps 5 and6.**

###<span style="color:blue">Question Nine</span>

**9. Use the margins command to produce a table of estimated population means for girls born to white mothers of average age by smoking status and education. (This requires you to run the regress command again with the factor variables i.smoke and i.education.)**



###<span style="color:blue">Question Ten</span>

**10. Extend the model from step 6 to investigate whether the adjusted difference in mean birthweight between boys and girls differs between black and white mothers. Is there any evidence at the 5% level that it does?**
